# Arduino Bluetooth NeoPixels
Control the color of the NeoPixels connected to the arduino with a phone. 

Connect a Bluetooth low energy breakout board to an Arduino and some NeoPixels. Download the iOS app
and control the color of the NeoPixels with an iPhone or iPad :) Either use the color picker module to pick
a color or stream the Quaternion sensor data which sets the color based on the pitch, yawn and roll 
rotation of the device. A potentiometer directly connected to the Arduino is used to control the 
brightness of the NeoPixels.
